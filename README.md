A web application and associated Windows desktop tools for doing pairwise
comparisons of files.

Windows desktop tools for pairwise comparisons of files

The main components of this program are:
pwv_main.py - this is the main application for doing pairwise comparisons. It contains
the main logic for both the judging panel and the settings panel. It uses the
QT UI form classes - Ui_MainWindow and Ui_Settings - that are stored in the
folder qt_forms.

pwv_main_en.py - is just a version of pwv_main that does not apply any
translation and so is in English. This is needed because pwv_main.py is
currently hard-coded to use the Portuguese translation (stored in pwv.ts and pwv.qm).
A better solution will be to have a single application with a language setting.

comparisons_csv.py - a class that stores the information about the outcomes of judgements
in a CSV file. Note that the application also uploads the same information to the server.
The CSV file is mostly there as a back up in case the server transfer goes wrong and also
as a quick way to check the judgements made so far. Used by pwv_main.py

shared_utilities.py - contains miscellaneous utilities for accessing data from the
online application and for displaying warnings and messages in QT applications.

file_match.py - utilities for grabbing files that match set criteria in a folder
and its subfolders. Used by folder_scanner.py

pwv_settings.json - the application saves its settings here.

folder_scanner.py - this is a simple QT Windows application that can scan a
folder and copy the list of file names (with complete paths) to the clipboard.

uploader.py - this is similar to folder_scanner, but can also upload the list
of files to the server. I suggest it is actually simpler not to use this
but just to use the folder_scanner application and copy-paste the files in to the
online application.

qt_forms - contains forms for the QT applications, converted from
.ui files using the pyuic4 tool
    - file_scanner_ui.py - for the file_scanner.py application
    - main.py - for the main pairwise application
    - settings.py - for the settings window in the main pairwise application
    - uploader.py - for the uploader application

qt_forms also contains the original .ui files automatically generated by the QT
Designer; and some translation files that are currently not used.

dist - contains the windows executable files generated using py2exe (http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial)
For example the main application executable is at pairwise\dist\pwv_main\pwv_main.exe.
The folder pairwise\dist\pwv_main can be copied onto another computer and run
there.

dist also contains a folder "platforms" containing one file, qwindows.dll. py2exe
sometimes fails to copy this folder and so it needs to be copied manually into
the dist folders.

build - contains the files generated by py2exe during the build and is safe to delete.

The tools are written in Python 2.7. I made some initial untested efforts to make them
Python 3-compatible.
